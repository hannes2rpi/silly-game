		<h3>You step out into the hallway and hear the growling noise again. As you continue to move down the hallway, the noise continues, almost as if it is guiding you somewhere. The growling takes you through hallways and tunnels covered in dirt. After following the growling for what felt like several days, you see a bright light at the end of the tunnel. As you reach your hand towards the light, you emerge outside. The tall grass seems to hug you as you pass by and continue your journey back home.</h3>

		<p>Congratulations! You survived and escaped. You can't help but wonder what that growling noise was coming from.</p>

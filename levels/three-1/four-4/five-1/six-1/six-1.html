		<h3>The book quickly flips to a passage called "MR. GOOSE." The passage reads "MR. GOOSE is the owner of the mansion. Ever since he brought Mrs. Goose inside, she has been acting strange. The couple moved in the day before their wedding night. MR. GOOSE has been known to bring many guests inside the mansion, yet it has been a long time since I have seen any of them leave. He is behind something sinister." You hear an angry honk behind you as you finish reading the passage.</h3>

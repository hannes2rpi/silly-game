		<h3>The book begins glowing a green color and flips to a passage labeled "ESCAPE." The passage reads, "In order to escape, an entity must locate an exit or be guided out of the mansion by..." The rest of the section appears to be torn off by claw marks. The book pauses for a moment, considering its next move. Suddenly, several bookshelves turn to open a tunnel hidden behind the wall. You thank the book before sprinting into the tunnel. The book turns to watch you, as if it is contemplating escaping as well. When you reach the field outside, there is a glowing book on the ground waiting for you.</h3>
